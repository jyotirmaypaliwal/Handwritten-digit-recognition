# Handwritten-digit-recognition

### Here we are using Logistic Regression on MNIST dataset. We used Sci-kit Learn to implement Logistic Regression. 
#### The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 70,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
#### We divided the data in testing and training set where 60,000 images were used for training and 10,000 images were used for testing.
We also used graphs to visualize data for our better understanding.

## Evaluation
### Correct predictions on test set - 91%
### Correct predictions on train set - 93%

As we can see there is much room for improvement.

## Note
We could have also used Fashion-MNIST data instead of just MNIST as Fashion_MNIST is a drop-in replacement to MNIST dataset.
