# Handwritten-digit-recognition

### Here I used Logistic Regression on MNIST dataset. I used Sci-kit Learn to implement Logistic Regression. 
#### The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 70,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
#### I divided the data in testing and training set where 60,000 images were used for training and 10,000 images were used for testing.
I also used graphs to visualize data for our better understanding.

## Evaluation
### Correct predictions on test set - 91%
### Correct predictions on train set - 93%


## Note
I could have also used Fashion-MNIST data instead of just MNIST as Fashion_MNIST is a drop-in replacement to MNIST dataset.
